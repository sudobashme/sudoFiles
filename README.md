# sudoFiles
osx config files I use for setting up macbook pro

----
### Usage:
```
git clone https://github.com/sudobashme/sudoFiles.git ~/GitHub/sudoFiles && ~/GitHub/sudoFiles/run && source install.sh
```

#### Note: 
I am currently using neovim and have added it to my .exports file. I don't have
it setup as part of this repo yet but the instructions I used to set it up can
be found here: https://github.com/rafi/vim-config
